# Why ConfigNG?

While participating in various maker communities, I learned about the Armbian community and a project called `configNG`. This project, although not actively developed, seemed to hold significant potential. Seeing its alignment with my own work, I decided to explore it further.

`configNG` is envisioned as the next generation of `armbian-config`, a crucial tool within the Armbian ecosystem. The aspiration is to modernize and enhance the existing tool, aiming for a more user-friendly and efficient experience.

## The Projects ConfigNG

### ConfigNG
`configNG` is a project aimed at streamlining configuration management across Linux ARM derivatives. It uses Armbian for testing but is designed to benefit all Linux users. The project includes several modules, each focused on different aspects of configuration management.

### Retro Interface

`retro-configNG` is a component of the `configNG` project. It's a tool designed for rapid testing and editing of configurations through a graphical user interface (GUI). This component aims to facilitate quicker iterations and improvements in the development process, providing a more visual approach to configuration management.

### Retro Interface GUI Edit

`configNG.edit` is a component of the `configNG` project. It's a tool designed for rapid testing of new features through the terminal user interface (TUI) for `configNG`, aiming to facilitate quicker iterations and improvements in the development process.

### bash-utility

`bash-utility` is a GitHub project that provides a collection of utility functions for Bash scripting. It leverages concepts from functional programming to make Bash scripts more robust, readable, and maintainable. This project is beneficial for developers who want to write cleaner and more efficient Bash scripts.

These projects and others are interconnected, each one building on the lessons and experiences of the previous. They represent a journey of learning and growth, of overcoming challenges and pushing boundaries. Although the projects are functional and have been tested, they are not yet at a production level. Please note that these projects are in the early stages of development and may be considered alpha or beta by some. This is my perspective and I acknowledge that others may have different views.
